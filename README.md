## Portfolio Website ##

My personal website was built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and features home, about, experience, and portfolio pages. I designed and developed the website, incorporating custom icons, animations, and a responsive layout for all devices. While the majority of the current website was completed over a few days during winter break, it reflects months of design iterations, feedback from friends, and continuous optimization.
